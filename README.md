# Optimizing-Manufacturing-Supply-Chain
Optimizing Manufacturing Supply Chain through a blend of Time Series and Neural Network models

Project Milestones

Problem Assessment: Aimed at enhancing the precision of demand forecasting within the client's intricate supply chain by leveraging sophisticated machine learning and predictive time-series models. This focus is particularly placed on key products that critically affect production efficiency and supplier dynamics.

Data Preparation: Undertook thorough exploratory data analysis to classify 1,304 unique materials, organizing them based on sales volume and variability. This classification serves as the foundation for specialized forecasting models.

Preprocessing: Executed product segmentation and incorporated cyclic features to augment the data architecture for more effective time-series analysis.

Model Building: Applied various forecasting methods, such as ARIMA, Prophet, Exponential Smoothing, and tailored deep learning techniques. These were adapted to suit the distinct variability traits of each product segment.

Dynamic Selection Box: Established a dynamic model selection system that identifies the optimal forecasting model for each material, selecting based on the lowest Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WMAPE).

Visualization Tools: Designed an elaborate Tableau dashboard that facilitates interactive visualizations of forecast data at the material-month granularity.

Results:
Enhanced forecasting accuracy by an improvement in MAPE by atleast 30%, directly contributing to better stock management, reducing both understock and overstock scenarios, thereby improving manufacturing efficiency and supplier relations.
